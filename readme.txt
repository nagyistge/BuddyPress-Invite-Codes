= Where should I contribute code back to the project? =

Thanks for asking!  Please do share back code modifications or enhancements you make for inclusion in BadgeOS core or as add-ons.

Visit us on [GitHub](https://github.com/opencredit/badgeos "BadgeOS on GitHub") to share your code with the BadgeOS community.

= Credly is really cool. How can I learn more about it? =

[Credly](https://credly.com/ "Credly web site") is the universal way to recognize, store and share life's achievements. We've integrated Credly into BadgeOS because it's downright the easiest, most fun way to collect evidence of all your achievements in one place and then share them out when and where it matters most. There are a rapidly growing number of platforms and apps that are using the Credly "Open Credit" API to enable sharable badges; the BadgeOS WordPress integration is just one great example! Visit us [Credly.com](https://credly.com "Credly on the Web") to learn more or [contact](https://credly.com/contact "Contact us") us for guidance with using the free Open Credit API in your own projects or applications.
